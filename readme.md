# ETS2 AI Co-Driver Plugin

This plugin adds an AI-powered virtual co-driver to Euro Truck Simulator 2 to enhance gameplay with context-aware dialogue, commentary, and assistance.

## Setup

1. Install ```./install.sh```

2. Configure settings in `src/config.py`:
   - Set `DEFAULT_SESSION_ID` to load an existing session (uuid, from ./data/sessions) or "new" to create one on startup
   - Set `DEFAULT_PROFILE_NAME` to load a specific co-driver profile from ./src/profiles

3. Run the plugin: ```python ./run.py```

## Usage

The plugin will automatically connect to the game's telemetry data and begin analyzing the driving context. The AI co-driver will provide dialogue through text-to-speech based on events like:

- Harsh braking
- Rapid acceleration
- Long highway stretches
- Navigation updates
- Job status changes

Press the configured hotkey (default: ALT) to toggle the co-driver's speech recognition for natural conversations.

## Customization

- Modify or create new co-driver profiles in `src/profiles/`
- Adjust plugin settings in `src/config.py`
- Implement custom telemetry event handlers in `src/domain/event/telemetry/handlers/`
- Extend core functionality by registering new modules in `PluginCore`

## Architecture Overview

- `src/application/`: High-level services and coordination
- `src/domain/`: Core business logic and event handling
- `src/infrastructure/`: Low-level technical implementations
- `src/shared/`: Common utilities and constants

The plugin leverages an event-driven architecture with an `EventBus` to loosely couple components. Telemetry data is continuously fetched and dispatched to relevant handlers for processing.
